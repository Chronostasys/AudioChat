# AudioChat
simple multi-user live audio chat app using signalr

## Motivation
Live voice chat with QQ is **SUCK**, and it consumes too many cpu that my games become lag.  
Steam is better, however it consumes more memory. And it's not that reliable.  
That's why I write this project. It's been used between me and my friends to perform live audio chat 
while playing 7dtd. It's really simple.  

## Features

What it provides:
- multi-user live voice chat
- low memory and cpou usage
- auto-reconnect and auto-device-switch
- latency control
- simple noise filtering

What it **doesn't** provide:
- anything related to security
- grouping (yes, anyone connect to the same server is in the same group)
- platform other than windows (client)
